      <h3>Here's what's left to do this semester:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Finish projects!</strong>   All of your games are looking very cool, so we'll have a blast 
          making them even cooler in the time we have left.  Try to keep all of your group members engaged!
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mission-bit-demo-day-spring17-tickets-33344662784">Demo Day</a> 
          is an important event each semester where all Mission Bit students gather to share their projects.  
          It takes place from <strong>5-7 PM on Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017 at 
          <a href="https://unity3d.com/company">Unity Technologies</a>, 30 Third Street in San Francisco</strong>.  
          Please invite family and friends to witness your amazing accomplishments!  Two groups from this class will 
          present their work, and we'll all arrive at 4:30 PM to set up before the event starts.  Please let me know 
          if you need to leave the event early or arrive late--we'll be organizing presentation schedules soon.
        </li>
        <li>
          For groups who will present on Demo Day: you have 3 minutes to speak and share your project, and we'll do 
          a dry run of our presentations before then.  It's OK if some ideas you had for your game aren't implemented 
          in time for presentation--the important thing is that the program doesn't crash and handles whatever features
          do exist in the game reasonably smoothly and you have a few ideas to talk about during the presentation.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Presentation slideshow</strong>: we'll need to prepare a brief slideshow to show off as part of 
          your presentation on Demo Day.  Here's a 
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11t5KgxA7O-3_nb3hwYtMCjbLyoi9wSF_JSJMlVjxwbk/edit">
          template</a> you can use.

          Mission Bit is offering three summer classes: Career Prep, Intro to Web Programming (this class), and Android Game Design.  <strong>I encourage everyone to participate!</strong>  
          Sign up at <a href="http://www.missionbit.com/">Mission Bit's website</a>.  You'll have the chance to continue 
          to develop your computer science skills in a collaborative setting.  This class covered a *lot* of material and a 
          second run can help the concepts to stick.  Or forge ahead with Android or Career Prep!

          <strong>Please stay in touch!</strong>  I'm happy to offer advice on what to do next or collaborate on a little 
          project.  I'd also love to hear feedback about what I can improve on in the class, or something you really liked 
          that I should keep doing.  My email is <strong>greg [at] missionbit.com</strong>.
