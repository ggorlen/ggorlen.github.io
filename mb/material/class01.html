      <li>Break into pairs and discuss equity in computer science.  Here are some questions to talk about:
        <ol>
          <li>Do you feel that you've been given an equal exposure to technology in school as other people you know?  In other words, which side of the "tech divide" are you on and why?</li>
          <li>Do you believe you could get a job in the tech industry when you graduate high school if you wanted to?  Why or why not?</li>
          <li>Would you consider attending college for computer science or attending a coding bootcamp after high school?  Why or why not?</li>
          <li>Do you have any concerns or fears about learning technology skills you would like to share?</li>
          <li><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">Growth mindset</a> may be described as the belief that your abilities aren't fixed, and that through hard work and perseverence, we can shape our abilities.  Please contrast this mindset with a fixed mindset.  On the spectrum between "fixed" and "growth" mindset, where do you see yourself?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Coding: what is it?  HTML: what is it?  Let's discuss.</li>
      <li>Begin working on our first website, the <a href="file:///C:/Users/greg/Documents/git/ggorlen.github.io/mb/rules.html">Class Rules</a> page, which will contain our community agreements.  Keep the rules positive!</li>
