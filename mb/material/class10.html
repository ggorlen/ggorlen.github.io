      <h1>Class 10: Javascript graphics</h1>
    
      <p>
        Today, we'll use everything we've discussed so far to build a graphics application, then spend some time walking through a <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> tutorial.   Once we complete these tasks, we'll dive into our group projects, which we'll focus on for the remainder of the semester.

      <h3>Today's topics:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Work as a class on some basic graphics concepts with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp">JS canvas</a>, one of the coolest parts of Javascript.  Canvas allows you to create complex animations and games in the browser.
          <ul>
            <li>Canvas is useful for demonstrating general concepts of graphics-based programming.  All graphics programs contain an <strong>initialization</strong> routine, which loads assets and sets variables to determine game parameters.  Graphics programs also contain an <strong>update</strong> function, which updates the game state on every game frame and re-draws all necessary components.  The update function is called multiple times per second by a <strong>timer</strong>.</li>
            <li>Check out this <a href="code/canvasdemo/">canvas demonstration program</a> which illustrates these concepts as well as <strong>collision detection</strong>, which is critical for game design and in some animations.
            <li>I have a bunch of more complex examples of graphics and normal JS scripts on <a href="https://github.com/ggorlen/ggorlen.github.io/tree/master/mb/code">Github</a> such as <a href="code/snake/">snake</a>, <a href="code/minesweeper/">minesweeper</a>, and <a href="code/tetris/">tetris</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Since canvas can be somewhat difficult to use, many libraries have been created which do a lot of the work for you, allowing you to focus on design rather than building everything from scratch.  Mission Bit has used a library called <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, which makes game development easier by simplifying collision detection, physics, code organization, and graphics.  We'll walk through a <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game">Phaser tutorial</a> together to familiarize ourselves with the library and discuss which projects it's most appropriate for.</li>
        <li><strong>Before leaving</strong>, please shut down your computer and plug it into a power source on the cart and place a couple chairs on desks.  (Thanks!)</li>
