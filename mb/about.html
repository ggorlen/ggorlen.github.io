                        <p>This course, Introduction to Web Development, is brought to you by 
                           <a href="https://www.missionbit.com">Mission Bit</a>, a nonproft organization 
                           based in San Francisco.  According to their mission statement:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong><em>
                            Mission Bit strives to eliminate the tech divide for youth 
                            living in urban poverty and rural areas across the San Francisco Bay Area by 
                            building computer programming and professional opportunity pathways for public school students.
                          </em></strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this end, this course strives to engage students by offering a variety of fun 
                          and creative projects exploring web design, peer to peer collaboration, and bringing 
                          ideas to life with computers.  There are many facets to web design can be explored with 
                          the tools we'll learn in class: games, websites, puzzles, math, and art, to name a few.  
                          The tools we'll use are among the most widespread for nearly all professional software 
                          engineers, developers, and people working with computers, and impact all of our lives 
                          on a daily basis.  Students will learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, 
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, 
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, 
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery">jQuery</a>, and 
                          <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, and will use these skills as a stepping stone 
                          to following their own pathways in computer science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Beyond computer science, students will develop many other life skills, such as team work 
                          and peer skills, overcoming obstacles and solving problems, developing a positive growth 
                          mindset, and using planning and focus to accomplish goals.
