                              by the letter 13 places ahead of it.  This can be accomplished in a few ways--this approach uses an array
                              that contains the entire alphabet to locate the proper rotation letter.

                                This is a great game for exploring algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">
                                breadth-first search</a>.  Even if that's too much for now, keep it in mind for later, or write
                                a simple version that just does the basic game (breadth-first search is used to allow the player
                                to find a path to a mouse click, which isn't mission critical).</td>
