        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Laptop lending</strong>:  if you're interested in borrowing a laptop for the semester, 
            please complete the 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1jYozNY44UfwEaBxIuO67G3H5zzJZcdL-QQRiOZkN4AA/edit?usp=sharing">
              Laptop lending form</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Let's break into some groups and spend half an hour planning class projects.  
              Here are some things to do and think about:
            <ul>
              <li>Brainstorm some possible project ideas (see the <a href="../resources">resources</a> page for ideas).
              <li>What tools and skills will we need to accomplish these projects?  Picking a specific 
                  project makes it easy to figure out which skills will be necessary to learn in our limited time.</li>
              <li>What roles will each person play in the project?  Programming is an obviously important 
                  part, but graphics, user interface, and planning/research may also be important tasks.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Re-convene and do a little sample project with arrays.</li>
        <li>Next week, we'll learn about graphics in Javascript.</li>
        <li><strong>Before leaving</strong>, please shut down your computer and plug it into a power source on the cart.</li>
      </ol>
