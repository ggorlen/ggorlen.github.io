      <h1>Class 5: Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    
      <p>
        Today, we'll wrap up HTML/CSS and ensure everyone is satisfied with how their page looks.  Feel free
        to continue working on your website throughout the semester.  We'll dive into 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, which is the main focus 
        of this course, and is the language we'll use to write our games.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal for the week is to learn Javascript by building a couple small apps: a program to greet a user, 
        which we'll expand into a <a href="../code/numberguesser/">number guessing game</a> and a couple of simple
        animations designed to make our websites interactive.  We'll use the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/">
        jQuery</a> library for a sample of the power of Javascript.
        During the course of the next few weeks, we'll learn more JS concepts and solve various puzzles and problems 
        in groups.
