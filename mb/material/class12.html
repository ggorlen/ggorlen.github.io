      <h1>Class 12: Projects!</h1>
    
      <p>
        This will be the last "lesson plan" as we transition into purely working on our projects.  You'll be supported throughout and we'll have a ton of fun, so don't worry!

          <a href="../code/samplesite/simpleanimation.html">Here</a>'s that animation and object project from Tuesday!  
          Download, read it, and play around with it!  Make more and less objects, mess with the random number generators, 
          and see how the class works to create objects.  Don't worry if you don't 100% understand it, we'll keep at it all 
          semester.  There are a ton of challenging concepts here!

        <li>Work on planning for your projects and begin coding.  Here are some pointers:
          <ul>
            <li>Discuss roles for each member of your team.  Keep everyone involved and helping out!  Here are a few suggestions:
              <ul>
                <li>Planner/organizer -- helps coordinate members of the group and maintains focus on specific tasks.</li>
                <li>Lead programmer -- writes code and hosts the main repository for the group on Github.  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/">Add the rest of the team as collaborators</a>.</li>
                <li>Lead graphics/designer -- communicates with programmer to determine pixel size of various assets.</li>
                <li>Support members to handle programming, ideas, research, and graphics components as necessary.</li>
                <li>Use <a href="http://collabedit.com/">Collab Edit</a> for working on the same file at the same time.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Break your game down into manageable chunks and figure out how to accomplish those small bits one at a time.  
              This is an extremely important strategy in problem solving!  
              For example, when I wrote Tetris, I approached the game (roughly) in the following sequence of steps:
              <ol>
                <li>Determine what my goal was and create a general plan.</li>
                <li>Set up variables, constants, and basic functions and objects.</li>
                <li>Get a square block to appear on screen.</li>
                <li>Get that block to move down the screen.</li>
                <li>Add keyboard input.</li>
                <li>Handle collisions for the active block to prevent it from going off the edges and to make it inactive when it reaches the bottom.</li>
                <li>Add more block types and write rotation functions for each block type.</li>
                <li>Add scores, images, and a second canvas element to hold the upcoming block.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Getting started on projects is the hardest part, especially since this is essentially your first program.  So we'll want to use the internet and tutorials to ensure we're headed down a reasonable path.  See the <a href="resources.html">class resources</a> page and <a href="material.html">course materials</a> pages for a full list of these resources or ask me directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Before leaving</strong>, please shut down your computer and plug it into a power source on the cart and place a couple chairs on desks.  (Thanks!)</li>
